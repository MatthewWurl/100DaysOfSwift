# Project 18 - Debugging

This project includes solutions to the challenges.

## Challenges

1. Temporarily try adding an exception breakpoint to project 1, then changing the call to `instantiateViewController()` so that it uses the storyboard identifier “Bad” – this will fail, but your exception breakpoint should catch it.
2. In [project 1](Project-01-StormViewer), add a call to `assert()` in the `viewDidLoad(`) method of DetailViewController.swift, checking that `selectedImage` always has a value.
3. Go back to project 5, and try adding a conditional breakpoint to the start of the `submit()` method that pauses only if the user submits a word with six or more letters.
